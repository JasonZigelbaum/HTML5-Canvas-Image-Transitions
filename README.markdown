<h1>HTML 5 Canvas Image Transitions</h1>
<p>This is a small library for image transitions using canvas. The demo uses a single animation called 'burn'. You are free to write your own and extend it, this is just an example.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="http://jasonzigelbaum.github.com/HTML5-Canvas-Image-Transitions/index.html">here</a>
<p>The only issue I've noticed is that the framerate is inconsistent across browsers. So know that before you consider it a perfect solution.</p>
<p>I'll be working on it more as time goes on. And feel free to come up with cool transitions- I wonder what kind of effects are possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for looking.</p>
